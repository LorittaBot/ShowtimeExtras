title: "Profile badges and their meanings"
---
For those who don't know, badges are emblems that appear on your `+profile`.

Badges that are not here are from my partner servers or from people who donated to me (you can see them on my Community Server). If you are on these servers, the badge they activated there will appear. Donating you can put one for your server. 

**Note:** If the personalized server badge disappears even though you're still on the server, don't be afraid! I probably must have restarted and, when I restart, you need to send a message or enter a voice channel on the server to retrieve the badge!
